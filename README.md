## Asia Antczak

I am an aspiring full stack developer in training, who has been given an amazing opportunity to become a <a href="https://www.makersacademy.com/fellowship/">Fellow student</a> at Makers Academy - highly selective, 16-week programming bootcamp. 

I graduated from Business Psychology and spend several years working in IT recruitment, Sales and Admin jobs. Despite being top performer in my roles, I never felt passion for it. 

I always enjoyed working with technology and wanted to learn some kind of technical skills, but thought without going back to university this door was closed for me. And then I discovered coding, tried few online tutorials and knew I finally found a career path that ticked all the boxes: fast paced environment, challenges, real world problems to solve and continuous learning. And it is so much fun!

My goal is to join a company that uses the newest technologies and best practices where I can develop projects which will positively impact people's lives.

## Skills

#### Problem Solving

Throughout my professional career I have been constantly challenged to solve problems- anything from dealing with unhappy customers, finding candidates with very rare skillsets, to resolving issues with incorrectly billed invoices which had been in query for months. I have tackled problems enthusiastically with willingness to find the best possible solution.

#### Attention to detail

When preparing billing I often had to double and triple check invoices to make sure customers would receive correct documents and team objectives were met. This really helped me fine tune my skills in debugging the code.

#### Eager Learner

I love learning and exploring new things. In my past jobs thanks to my natural curiosity I was able to quickly adapt to my environment and pick up the necessary skills fast.
I have also gone beyond my role and actively seek new tasks to broaden my skillset. In my last position within first few weeks I knew more about the subjects we were working on then some of the senior members of the team. 

#### Team Work

Throughout my professional life I have had opportunity to work both in small and large scale teams. I enjoy collaborating with others, sharing ideas and knowledge. In my previous role I often helped others with their tasks to make sure our team would meet targets. I have also coached team members and recommended improvements that resulted in a better customer experiences.
