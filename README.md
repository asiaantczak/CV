I am an aspiring full stack developer in training, who has been given an amazing opportunity to become a <a href="https://www.makersacademy.com/fellowship/">Fellow student</a> at Makers Academy - highly selective, 16-week programming bootcamp.

I graduated from Business Psychology and spend several years working in IT recruitment, Sales and Admin jobs. Despite being top performer in my roles, I never felt passion for it.

I always enjoyed working with technology and wanted to learn some kind of technical skills, but thought without going back to university this door was closed for me. And then I discovered coding, tried few online tutorials and knew I finally found a career path that ticked all the boxes: fast paced environment, challenges, real world problems to solve and continuous learning. And it is so much fun!

I am looking for my first software developer role that will constantly challenge me to learn more and improve.
My goal is to join a company that uses the newest technologies and best practices where I can develop projects which will positively impact people's lives.

## Skills

#### Problem Solving

Throughout my professional career I have been constantly challenged to solve problems- anything from dealing with unhappy customers, finding candidates with very rare skillsets, to resolving issues with incorrectly billed invoices which had been in query for months. I took this skill even further with Makers Academy course, where I have been working on solving coding challenges every day.

#### Attention to detail

When preparing billing I often had to double and triple check invoices to make sure customers would receive correct documents and team objectives were met. It helps me a lot in programming and minimizing the risk of bugs in my code.

#### Eager Learner

I love learning and exploring new things. In my past jobs thanks to my natural curiosity I was able to quickly adapt to my environment and pick up the necessary skills fast. I have also gone beyond my role and actively seek new tasks to broaden my skillset.

#### Team Work

Throughout my professional life I have had opportunity to work both in small and large scale teams. I enjoy collaborating with others, sharing ideas and knowledge. In my previous role I often helped others with their tasks to make sure our team would meet targets. I have also coached team members and recommended improvements that resulted in a better customer experiences.
